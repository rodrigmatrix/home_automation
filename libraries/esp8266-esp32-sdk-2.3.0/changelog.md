## Version 2.2.4 

New:
- Added example for `SinricProTemperaturesensor`

Bugfix:
- Fixed typo in `onTargetTemperature` event

---

## Version 2.2.3

New :
- Added GarageDoorExample (ArudinoIDE) including wiring diagram
  This is based on `SinricProLock` device

Code optimizations:
- Changed callbacks to use `const String&` in callback functions
  to avoid unnecessary string copying
- Changed event limitiation to prevent server flooding

---

## Version 2.2.2

New Feature:
- `SinricPro.setResponseMessage(String &&message)`  allows to return a meaningful error message if callback returned false. 
  This message will shown in a red box on SinricPro portal website.  

- SinricProLock return state "JAMMED" now if callback failed (returned false)

Code optimization
- SinricProDevice is now default handler for powerState event/request

- SinricProSwitch is now a typedef to SinricProDevice since SinricProDevice handles onPowerState

- removed unneccessary includes

Bug fixes
- Fixed json protocol on events
- Fixed URL in library.properties
- Fixed UDP

---

## Version 2.2.1

New features:

- New Callback functions for onConnected / onDisconnected
  - SinricPro.onConnected(std::function<void(void)>);
  - SinricPro.onDisconnected(std::function<void(void)>);

- Automatic device addition
  - You can use ```SinricProSwitch& mySwitch = SinricPro[DEVICEID];``` to add a new device.

Changed:
- Stronger id validation (app-key, app-secret and deviceIds)
- Added more details to debug log about wrong id's

Fixed:
- Typos

---

## Version 2.2.0

New features:
- Removed NTPClient dependency
- Extract timeStamp from messages
  Keep timestamp in sync without NTP
- RestoreDeviceStates
  Request last known device states from server

Changed:
- Processessing of incomming messages
  Prepared for client-sided requests and server-sided responses
- Processing of outgoing messages
  Messages stored without signature / timestamp in sendQueue
  Timestamp and signature will applied while sendQueue is processed

---
